This project will be the last project of mine in The Odin Project Foundations course. It is meant to showcase my abilities with mostly javascript, but I will try and add some flare with css and make it look pretty.

As I develop this I will focus first on the javascript, then add in CSS to make it look presentable after everything else is done. 

This project is also meant to show how far I've come in my HTML/CSS/Javascript journey over these last 3-4 months. I hope you enjoy my project.
